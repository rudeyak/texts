### 🔐Your 2025 cyber security resolution!

The single best thing you can do to protect yourself and the firm from cyber attacks in 2025 is strengthen your online account security. Executives are prime targets for cyberattacks. Sophisticated cyber criminals covet access to _any_ of your accounts, business _and_ personal. 

**Why it matters:** Traditional MFA methods (e.g. those 6-digit codes received via text or email, or typed in from an app) are vulnerable to phishing and SIM-swapping attacks. FIDO2, a cutting-edge authentication standard, provides unparalleled protection by eliminating passwords and integrating strong device-based security. FIDO2-enabled MFA secures your accounts using cryptographic keys stored on hardware devices or built into smartphones. Even if a hacker obtains your password, FIDO2 blocks access without your physical device.

**Key benefits:**
1. **Phishing-proof authentication:** FIDO2 ensures only _you_, using _your_ authorized devices can access your accounts.
2. **Ease of use:** Logging in becomes faster and more secure (there's nothing faster than tapping your finger on a reader or smiling at your smartphone).
3. **Versatility:** Works with a wide range of services, from Google and Microsoft to banking platforms.

Paying attention to detail: invalidate old sessions!

Unauthorized access often persists via older, less-secure sessions. Your account can be logged in from many places at once, which is convenient both for you _and_ potentially to a cyber criminal who has gained access. Clearing these ensures only your known, secure logins remain active. Here's how:

  - **Gmail:** [Review devices](https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity) and sign out of any unfamiliar sessions.
  - **Outlook:** Visit [Microsoft Account Devices](https://account.microsoft.com/devices) and sign out of all unnecessary sessions.
  - **Facebook:** Check active sessions [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security) and click "Log out of all sessions."
  - **Twitter:** Go to [Twitter Apps and Sessions](https://twitter.com/settings/sessions) and log out of unfamiliar devices.
  - **Amazon:** Go to [Secure Your Account](https://www.amazon.com/a/c/secureyouraccount) and tap the "Sign out non-Amazon devices" link.
  - **Other services:** Look for "Active Sessions" or "Logged-In Devices" in account security settings and log out of all unnecessary devices.
