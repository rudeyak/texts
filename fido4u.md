**Why FIDO2 MFA is your security upgrade**

**Why it matters:** Executives are prime targets for cyberattacks. Your online accounts—email, banking, social media—are treasure troves for cybercriminals. Traditional MFA methods (like SMS codes) are vulnerable to phishing and SIM-swapping attacks. FIDO2, a cutting-edge authentication standard, provides unparalleled protection by eliminating passwords and integrating strong device-based security.

**The big picture:** FIDO2-enabled MFA secures your accounts using cryptographic keys stored on hardware devices or built into smartphones. Even if a hacker obtains your password, FIDO2 blocks access without your physical device.

**Key benefits:**
1. **Phishing-proof authentication:** FIDO2 ensures only authorized devices can access your accounts.
2. **Ease of use:** Logging in becomes faster and more secure.
3. **Versatility:** Works with a wide range of services, from Google and Microsoft to banking platforms.
